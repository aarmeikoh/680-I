# COVID-19 Restrictions and their Effect on the Spread of the Virus

Since the beginning of the spread of Covid-19 governments have tried different ways to attempt to curb the effects of the virus. States and counties have implemented mandates to varying degrees. What effect have these mandates had on the fallout of the virus? This study attempts to measure the effect certain regulations have on the number of deaths from Covid-19. Does the regulation reduce the number of deaths? Can accurate models to predict deaths be created to model outcome with and without the regulations?

The {Center for Disease Control (CDC)}[https://data.cdc.gov/browse?category=Policy+Surveillance] has been collecting Covid-19 data and the data available for each county. The data is available both as latest numbers and a day-by-day report. Using the daily data, a time series data frame can be created to follow trends through the spread of the virus.
Information regarding Covid-19 regulations has been made available through the {Covid Act Now API}[https://covidactnow.org/data-api]. The data is available as a collection of data frames with information regarding regulations for each county for the given dates. Using these data sets together it is possible to obtain the death rate for each county along with information regarding the regulations.
By analyzing the data and comparing the results for different counties it should be possible to measure the effectiveness of different regulations. Using modeling techniques will make it possible to see how implementing or choosing not to enact mandates would have affected the spread of Covid-19.
